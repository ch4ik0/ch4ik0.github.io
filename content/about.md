My name is Eder PÃ©rez Ignacio. I like to understand the workings and reasons behind things; the how and why. This lets me use them in an unintended way, employ lateral thinking and see them from an adversarial perspective, which are some of the things I also enjoy doing.

I currently work as an Offensive Security Engineer and Team Leader at Ayesa. I'm heavily focused on both penetration testing and adversarial simulation (a.k.a. red teaming).
